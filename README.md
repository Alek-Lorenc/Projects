# Projects
This repository contains student projects written by me or teams I belonged to.


1) Option Pricing in Hull-White Model is a project in which options for Microsoft stock (data from 2019) are priced under Hull-White model. 


2) Credit Risk Barrier Model Project is a project in which I simulate trajectories of a company value (given by stochastic equation), debt barrier and currencies prices (as well stochastic). The goal is to check, according to the classic credit risk barrier model, which of the given possible situations of debt allocation gives the highest expectation ot the rate of return for the Equity part of the company (V=D+E).


3) Vostock Temp. Time Series is a project in which an ARIMA model is built in order to explain the time series of monthly mean temperatures measured at the Vostock station (Russian research station located in Antarctica). The data set needed for the calculations is located in the file named VTTS_Data.xlsx.


4) Wine Quality Analysis is a project in which three types of model (linear regression, logistic regression and decision tree) are built in order to explain integer-rated quality of wine. The data set needed for the calculations is located in the file named WQA_DATA.xlsx.

This repository contains student projects written by me or teams I belonged to.


Credit Risk Barrier Model Project is a project in which I simulate trajectories of a company value (given by stochastic equation), debt barrier and currencies prices (as well stochastic). The goal is to check, according to the classic credit risk barrier model, which of the given possible situations of debt allocation gives the highest expectation ot the rate of return for the Equity part of the company (V=D+E).


Vostock Temp. Time Series is a project in which an ARIMA model is built in order to explain the time series of monthly mean temperatures measured at the Vostock station (Russian research station located in Antarctica).
